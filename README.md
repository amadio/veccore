# VecCore

**VecCore** is a simple abstraction layer on top of other vectorization
libraries. It provides an architecture-independent [API](doc/api.md) for
expressing vector operations on data. Code written with this API can then
be dispatched to one of several [backends](doc/backends.md) implemented using
libraries like [Vc](https://github.com/VcDevel/Vc),
[UME::SIMD](https://github.com/edanor/umesimd), or a scalar implementation.
This allows one to get the best performance on platforms supported by Vc and
UME::SIMD without losing portability to unsupported architectures like PowerPC,
for example, where the scalar backends can be used instead without requiring
changes in user code. Another advantage is that, unlike with compiler intrinsics,
the same code can be compiled for SSE, AVX2, AVX512, etc, without modifications.
With the addition of new backends, such as the new backend based on C++20 and
`std::experimental::simd`, users can automatically take advantage of new
features and better performance. This backend supports AVX512 on Intel/AMD64 and
NEON on ARM/ARM64, with best performance in most cases. However, it does require
compiling code in C++20 mode, which may not always be possible, so there is
still an advantage in using it via VecCore's implementation to have a fallback
when C++20 is not avaialble.

## Example

The [bench](bench/) directory of the repository has several usage examples of
the VecCore API that are used to compare how different backends perform in
various circumstances. Below we show how to convert a scalar function to compute
a [Julia Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set) to work with SIMD instructions:

#### Scalar Implementation

```cpp
void julia(float xmin, float xmax, int nx, flaot ymin, float ymax, int ny,
           int max_iter, unsigned char *image, float real, float im)
{
    float dx = (xmax - xmin) / nx;
    float dy = (ymax - ymin) / ny;

    for (int i = 0; i < nx; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < ny; ++j) {
            int k = 0;
            float x = xmin + i * dx, cr = real, zr = x;
            float y = ymin + j * dy, ci = im, zi = y;

            do {
                x  = zr*zr - zi*zi + cr;
                y  = 2.0f * zr*zi + ci;
                zr = x;
                zi = y;
            } while (++k < max_iter && (zr*zr + zi*zi < 4.0f));

            image[ny*i + j] = k;
        }
    }
}
```

#### SIMD Implementation using VecCore

```cpp
template<typename T>
void julia_v(Scalar<T> xmin, Scalar<T> xmax, size_t nx, Scalar<T> ymin, Scalar<T> ymax, size_t ny,
             Scalar<Index<T>> max_iter, unsigned char *image, Scalar<T> real, Scalar<T> im)
{
    T iota(0.0);
    for (size_t i = 0; i < VectorSize<T>(); ++i)
        Set<T>(iota, i, i);

    T dx = T(xmax - xmin) / T(nx);
    T dy = T(ymax - ymin) / T(ny), dyv = iota * dy;

    for (size_t i = 0; i < nx; ++i) {
        for (size_t j = 0; j < ny; j += VectorSize<T>()) {
            Scalar<Index<T>> k(0);
            T x = xmin + T(i) * dx,       cr = real, zr = x;
            T y = ymin + T(j) * dy + dyv, ci = im, zi = y;

            Index<T> kv(0);
            Mask<T> m(true);

            do {
                x = zr*zr - zi*zi + cr;
                y = T(2.0) * zr*zi + ci;
                MaskedAssign<T>(zr, m, x);
                MaskedAssign<T>(zi, m, y);
                MaskedAssign<Index<T>>(kv, m, ++k);
                m = zr*zr + zi*zi < T(4.0);
            } while (k < max_iter && !MaskEmpty(m));

            for (size_t k = 0; k < VectorSize<T>(); ++k)
                image[ny*i + j + k] = (unsigned char) Get(kv, k);
        }
    }
}
```

The differences appear where branching is required and masks need to be used
instead of simple conditionals. In some places, casting scalars to the correct
type is also necessary in order enable their promotion to the correct SIMD vector
type.

#### Performance

Gains in performance usually depend not only on the code being vectorized, but
also on the runtime characteristics of the actual computations. For example,
when computing Julia sets, it matters what structure it has, as that determines
how much coherence there is between nearby pixels. That is, the more iterations
that get computed in vector mode for nearby pixels, the more performance is
improved. On the other hand, when more iterations are performed with elements
masked out, speedup is lower. Therefore, the fractal with the largest interior
consisting of diverging points (shown in black) has the largest speedup. The
figure below illustrates this fact for different fractals (left) by showing the
speedup as the point where the lines cross the axis of the radial plot (right).

VecCore, you will need a compiler with support for C++17. We recommend using at
least the following compiler versions:

 - GCC 11.0
 - Clang 14.0
 - AppleClang 15.0
 - IntelÂ® C/C++ Compiler 19.1
